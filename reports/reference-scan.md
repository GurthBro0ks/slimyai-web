# Reference Scan Report - slimyai_setup

**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Purpose:** Document what was referenced from the read-only slimyai_setup repository

## Summary

The slimyai_setup repository was available for reference, but no specific data was extracted or imported for this mobile polish work. All changes were made based on:

1. The annotated screenshots provided by the user
2. The detailed requirements document (pasted_content.txt)
3. Existing code patterns in slimyai-web

## Role IDs (from requirements document)

The requirements document specified these role IDs for reference:
- Admin roles: `['1178129227321712701','1216250443257217124']`
- Club role: `['1178143391884775444']`

These were noted but not needed for the mobile polish work, as the role-based access control was already implemented in the slimyai-web codebase.

## Branding Consistency

The main reference point was ensuring consistent branding:
- **Brand name:** `slimy.ai` (lowercase)
- **Tagline:** "fueled by adhd — driven by feet — motivated by ducks"
- **Hero subhead:** "Panel of Power"

These were already present in various forms in the codebase and were standardized across all pages.

## Copy and Messaging

The following copy patterns were maintained or updated:
- Login button text: "Login" (mobile), "Login with Discord" (desktop)
- Usage badge: Compact display on mobile
- Callout messages: Made more concise and inline
- Empty states: Friendly, actionable messages

## Files Examined in slimyai_setup

- Scanned directory structure to understand project organization
- No specific files were copied or imported
- No secrets or sensitive data were accessed

## Conclusion

The mobile polish work was completed using only the slimyai-web repository and the requirements provided. The slimyai_setup repository served as a reference for understanding the broader ecosystem but no code or configuration was imported from it.

All changes were made in accordance with the "read-only reference" guardrail specified in the requirements.
