2. `feat: update snail and features pages with unified card styling`
3. `fix: resolve lint errors and warnings`
4. `fix: resolve TypeScript type assertion issue in ask-manus-bar`

## Remaining Issues (Pre-existing)

All remaining lint errors and warnings existed before this work and are documented in `reports/codex-tasks.md` for a separate refactoring PR. They do not affect the mobile polish functionality.

### Categories:
1. React Hooks in async components (docs pages)
2. setState in effect patterns (status page)
3. require() vs ES6 imports (config files)
4. TypeScript any types (API routes)
5. Unused variables (various files)
6. useEffect dependencies (codes page)

## Delta from Initial Scan

- 14 lint errors, 15 warnings

**After:**
