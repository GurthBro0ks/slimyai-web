## UI/UX Issues from Screenshots

1. **Header/Branding:**
   - "Slimy.ai" should be "slimy.ai" (lowercase)
   - "Loading Usage..." overlaps logo on mobile
   - Login button should show "Login" on mobile, "Login with Discord" on desktop

2. **Hero Section:**
   - Should say "Panel of Power" as subhead
   - Remove "Ready to get started?" section entirely
   - Remove "Join thousands..." text

3. **Feature Cards:**
   - Need unified mobile-friendly styling
   - Should be single column on mobile
   - Consistent rounded borders and spacing

4. **Chat Page:**
   - Large yellow warning banner should be compact callout
   - "Real-time chat requires WebSocket" message needs better styling

5. **Club Analytics:**
   - "Connect Admin API" message should be small info chip, not full-width banner

6. **Timeline:**
   - "Could not load timeline events" shows red error text
   - Should show friendly empty state with CTA

7. **Status Page:**
   - Need to distinguish "Not configured" vs "Degraded" vs "Down"
   - Admin API and Codes Aggregator need proper state handling

8. **Footer:**
   - Should use horizontal scrollable layout on mobile
   - Product/Tools/Community sections need better mobile organization
